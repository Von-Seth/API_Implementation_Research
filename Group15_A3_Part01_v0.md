## API Overview

* Winnipeg Transit API provides a method for people to get information of transit services. This API is designed to provide real-time schedules for busses at a stop and bus routes. Our API is designed to be fast, reliable and easy to use. The API has two filter queries and one identity query that can be used to find and create resources such as bus routes, stop info and bus schedules.
  
## Resources

2. Stop info: Gets a list of buses that can arrive at the requested bus stop.
3. Bus schedule: Get the next bus information that will arrive at the requested bus stop.

Data requested is returned as json format by default.
